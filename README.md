### Current Features

1. Automatically claim the SCOT tokens (PAL, SCT, ZZAN, etc.) for the users of this service every 2 hours


### How to Use

In order to register for autopilot,

1. Authorize @self-driving account with steemconnect [https://steemconnect.com/authorize/@self-driving](https://steemconnect.com/authorize/@self-driving) to grant the posting authority. You can check whether you did this successfully in `Authorities` section in [https://steemd.com/@{your_account}](https://steemd.com/@{your_account})
1. Delegate at least 2 SP to @self-driving account, so it knows you want to enable the service. The delegation tool such as [https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/](https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/) can be used for the delegation. We'll cancel the needs for delegation after this service gets mature, and you can undelegate the SP then.

### Future Plan

- We may support more "autopilot" features for the users in the future, such as a smarter vote bot for Steem Engine communities, alert for token price trends, etc.

We'll update the doc after more features are available for surfing the Steem and Steem Engine world more efficiently.
