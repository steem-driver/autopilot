### Current Features

1. Automatically claim the SCOT tokens (PAL, SCT, ZZAN, etc.) for the users of this service every hour


### How to Use

In order to register for autopilot,

1. Authorize @self-driving account with steemconnect [https://steemconnect.com/authorize/@self-driving](https://steemconnect.com/authorize/@self-driving) to grant the posting authority. You can check whether you did this successfully in `Authorities` section in [https://steemd.com/@{your_account}](https://steemd.com/@{your_account})
1. Delegate at least 2 SP to @self-driving account as a service registration step, so autopilot knows you want to enable the service. The delegation tool such as [https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/](https://steemyy.com/sp-delegate-form/) can be used for the delegation. We need this delegation step because we don't have a decent UI for this service yet. We'll cancel the needs for delegation after this service gets mature, and you can undelegate the SP then.


### Future Plan

- Improve the Autopilot UI and user experience
- support more "autopilot" features for the users in the future, such as a smarter vote bot for SCOT communities and applications, alert for token price trends / patterns, etc.

We'll update the doc after more features are available for surfing the Steem and Steem Engine world more efficiently.
